# ng-tournament-generator


This project was made to practice with Angular :) 


Functionality:  
1. Create your own tournament.
2. Add team.
3. Add match info.
4. Remove played match in match history component.

This project stores data in memory right now, but I have plans to add some MongoDB DB and some authentication functionality in future.
